# challenge-4-javascript-quiz

## Description
The purpose of this website is to study questions related to javascript. It will keep track of the number of questions correct and will display your score so you can see how you rank among others or your previous attempts. I built this website so I have an interactive way of studying that will be more effective than flash cards or other studying methods. I learned how to create a timer that will decrease in time and how to create arrays. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
In order to use the website, press the start quiz button. A question will appear with 4 answers and the correct answer needs to be selected. An incorrect answer will still move on to the next question but will decrease the timer by 15 seconds. When all questions are answered or the timer runs out, the quiz will end and the user will input their initials in the highscore.
